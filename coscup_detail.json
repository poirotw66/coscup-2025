        "description": "As project teams become more aware of security, the demand for security audits before deploying contracts on-chain has also increased. Consequently, audit platforms and related services have become more diverse. However, existing static analysis tools have limitations in detecting certain common vulnerabilities, often leading developers to discover issues only after receiving audit reports. This extends the remediation timeline and increases costs. Additionally, such vulnerabilities are frequently classified as medium to high risk in audit competitions or security platforms, potentially resulting in financial losses, further underscoring the need to enhance detection capabilities.  \r\n\r\nThis session will explore several types of these vulnerabilities and introduce a corresponding **Prompt-based vulnerability detection process**, demonstrating how AI can be leveraged to enhance security audits. Using the **slippage minAmountOut vulnerability** as an example, we will showcase the effectiveness of AI-assisted detection, ultimately optimizing security lifecycle management—from development and auditing to continuous monitoring."

This talk explores how to leverage the power of Edge AI and on-device processing using open-source tools to create intelligent agents that operate entirely without an internet connection, enhancing privacy, reducing latency, and enabling new functionalities independent of the cloud.\r\n\r\nWe'll focus on using lightweight, state-of-the-art open models, particularly Google's open Gemma family, which are designed to run efficiently directly on edge devices, potentially leveraging execution frameworks like the open-source MediaPipe (available for both Mobile and Web). Discover how these models form the \"brain\" of our offline agents. We'll showcase practical implementation using Flutter as a primary case study, introducing an open-source plugin (flutter_gemma) (developed by the speaker) designed to seamlessly integrate models like Gemma within this popular cross-platform framework, illustrating principles applicable across platforms.\r\n\r\nLearn the practical steps to implement these agents: from selecting appropriate on-device model variants (like the latest Gemma models, or popular open alternatives such as Deepseek and Mistral Small) based on task requirements, to integrating them into your application architecture. Using Flutter and the plugin as our concrete example, we will explore techniques for structuring agent tasks and touch upon fine-tuning methods. Crucially, we will discuss the trade-offs involved – weighing the benefits of Edge AI versus traditional cloud-based AI solutions for Mobile and Web.

Building with tamper-evident logs means that you can cryptographically prove that the data hasn’t been unexpectedly changed.\r\n\r\nWe will discuss how this technology, famously used in Certificate Transparency, can be broadly applied to secure the open-source software supply chain with Sigstore, and Android Pixel binary transparency.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate these concepts, this talk also introduces Tessera, an open-source Go library for building tile-based transparency logs using these standard formats on both major cloud and on-premises infrastructure, together with TesseraCT, a readily deployable open-source solution for Certificate Transparency using Tessera.\r\n\r\nAttendees will gain insights into a lightweight yet powerful library for building their own reliable and easily maintainable transparency solutions. We will showcase a concrete example of its application.\r\n\r\nNo background knowledge required."

        "description": "大型語言模型（LLM）的運算需求正在降低，這讓我想到能不能讓 LLM 跑在自己設計的 OS上。這個想法來自於我撰寫OS的過程。\r\n\r\nLLM 需要完整的 Linux 環境來運行，但如果我們能在較簡陋的 OS 上和 LLM 通訊，是否能開啟更多嵌入式 AI 應用的可能性？像是離線導覽機、即時翻譯設備，甚至是不依賴完整 OS 的AI 系統。\r\n\r\n為了驗證我的想法，我嘗試寫了一個 POC，並讓 OS 跑在 RISC-V 32 架構上，再透過 virtio 最終與 LLM 通訊。整個流程如下：\r\n\r\n1. 自製 OS 透過 virtio 接收問題，並寫入檔案。\r\n2. Host 端的 Python 程式監聽 virtio 產生的檔案變更，讀取輸入的字串。\r\n3. Host 端的 Python 程式 將字串傳送給 LLM，獲取 AI 生成的回應。\r\n4. LLM 的回應 再次透過 Python 程式寫回 virtio 的輸出檔案。\r\n5. 自製 OS 讀取 virtio 內的檔案內容，並將結果輸出到終端。\r\n這樣一來，我的 OS 就能與 LLM 互動，而不需要完整的 Linux 環境。\r\n\r\n透過這次的會議，我希望向開發者請教在沒有完整 OS 的情況下，是否有更好的方法來構建 LLM 系統？\r\n\r\n這是一個關於作業系統、虛擬化與 AI 的實驗，如果您對這個主題有興趣，歡迎一起討論！"

        "description": "The computing requirements for Large Language Models (LLMs) are decreasing, which made me wonder if it’s possible to run an LLM on an operating system (OS) that I designed myself. This idea came from my experience in developing an OS.\r\n\r\nCurrently, LLMs need a full Linux environment to run, but what if we could communicate with an LLM on a simpler OS? Would this open up new possibilities for embedded AI applications, such as offline navigation machines, real-time translation devices, or AI systems that don’t rely on a full OS?\r\n\r\nTo test my idea, I created a proof of concept (PoC) and ran my OS on a RISC-V 32 architecture. I then used virtio to enable communication with the LLM. The process works as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The custom OS receives a question through virtio and writes it to a file.\r\n2. A Python program on the host monitors changes to the file created by virtio and reads the input string.\r\n3. The Python program sends the string to the LLM and gets the AI-generated response.\r\n4. The response from the LLM is written back to the output file through the Python program.\r\n5. The custom OS reads the file content from virtio and displays the result in the terminal.\r\nWith this setup, my OS can interact with an LLM without requiring a full Linux environment.\r\n\r\nThrough this session, I hope to ask developers if there are better ways to build an LLM system without a full OS.\r\n\r\nThis is an experiment in operating systems, virtualization, and AI. If you're interested in this topic, let's discuss it together!"

        "title": "What Open-Source Policies Are European Communities Watching? — Notes from FOSDEM 2025",
        "description": "FOSDEM (the Free and Open-Source Developers’ European Meeting) is widely regarded as a barometer of global open-source trends. This year, the OCF delegation came back with two key takeaways: developments on the security & sustainability policy front and on the compliance & community-collaboration front.\r\n\r\nOn the security & sustainability policy front, the EU’s brand-new Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) now requires every connected product to ship with a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), making the entire supply chain transparent at a glance. The original draft pushed liability onto volunteer maintainers; after intense community lobbying it was revised to “corporate liability, public-interest projects exempt,” though the debate is far from over. In parallel, the OpenSSF released automated SBOM-generation and vulnerability-reporting tools; the EU expanded its governmental OSPOs and launched a Sovereign Tech Fund—leveraging law for transparency and money for resilience—to ensure long-term maintenance of critical projects.\r\n\r\nOn the compliance & community-collaboration front, SBOM became this year’s FOSDEM buzzword and even earned its own dedicated track. Sessions ranged from format standards and tooling to real-time disclosure workflows, underscoring a “community sets the rules, enterprises implement them” mindset and promoting automation to ease maintainers’ burden. Several national OSPOs shared cross-agency models: Germany pools SBOM databases across government, foundations, and communities, while France uses hackathons to train civil servants in hands-on compliance—turning security from a single checkpoint into a supply-chain-wide practice.\r\n\r\nFor the Taiwanese community, now is the perfect time to get fluent in SBOM and the CRA. Will the CRA trigger GDPR-style ripple effects worldwide? Observers are watching closely. Meanwhile, Europe’s “open-source-first” stance is reshaping how governments and communities work together. Curious how policy is rewriting the open-source landscape—and how Taiwan can get ahead of the curve? See you at COSCUP!"

        "description": "An IDE is the most essential daily tool for software engineers. But what do you do when it doesn't quite fit your workflow—complain, endure, or hack it yourself? This talk introduces the process of building IntelliJ Platform plugins using Kotlin, empowering you to customize your IDE to match your needs. We'll cover practical techniques including setting up the development environment, initializing the project, understanding extension points, modifying menus and UI elements, and adding icons and animations. A live example will demonstrate how to create a custom progress bar component and redesign the theme style of your IDE. Even if you're not familiar with the IDE’s source code, you’ll walk away knowing how to take full control and make your IDE truly your own. The smoother your tools, the smoother your code."

        "title": "Spinlocks Reimagined: Enhancing Synchronization in Multi-Core Systems",
        "description": "In the era of rapid processor advancements, simply increasing clock frequency no longer meets performance demands, making multi-core processors the dominant trend. While multi-core architectures deliver significant performance gains, they also introduce challenges in synchronizing shared resources. Efficiently managing resource access in multi-core environments has become a central issue in operating system and application design. Spinlocks, as a lightweight synchronization mechanism, play a critical role in addressing these challenges. This talk will delve into the evolution and innovation of spinlock technologies, guiding attendees through the past, present, and future of synchronization from an open-source perspective, while providing practical open-source tools and knowledge to build high-performance spinlocks tailored to their own systems.\r\n\r\nThe presentation is structured into three main segments:\r\n1. glibc's Pthread Spinlock:\r\nExplore the implementation principles of Pthread Spinlock in glibc, dissecting its limitations in multi-core settings to help attendees grasp fundamental spinlock concepts.\r\n2. Linux Kernel's QSpinlock:\r\nExamine the design and operational mechanisms of QSpinlock in the Linux kernel, analyzing how it improves upon traditional spinlocks and addressing its shortcomings in high-contention scenarios.\r\n3. RON Spinlock:\r\nIntroduce RON Spinlock, developed by our lab, a routing table-based spinlock that pre-calculates the shortest circular path between cores to generate an efficient lock-unlock sequence. This approach significantly reduces inter-core communication costs and waiting times, achieving higher performance at a lower cost while ensuring fairness.\r\n\r\nAttendees will gain comprehensive insights into spinlock technologies and learn about the innovative design of RON Spinlock. We will provide code for measuring core-to-core latency on attendees’ own systems, enabling them to build customized Routing Tables and create high-performance spinlocks in user space. All related code and documentation will be uploaded to GitHub for community collaboration and application."

The L2 project does not need to change the security-related design because there is no need to change the security-related design.\r\nOn the other hand, how to sort packaged transactions does not affect security, so new designs have been introduced in the \"how to sort transactions\" area, and each L2 also chooses the transaction sorting mechanism according to its own preference. From the earliest Centralized Sequencing to Decentralized Sequencing, to the recent Based Sequencing and Sequencing with TEE, this talk will consider the design of transaction sequencing and introduce the advantages and disadvantages of different designs.

For example, flatpak, one of Linux app manager implements the filesystem with OSTree in the sandbox.  If OSTree goes with an OS filesystem, this feature is applicable to over-the-air (OTA) updates of industrial and automotive control systems.

        "description": "As the applications of LLMs become increasingly widespread, the memory requirements for loading open-source model weights are also becoming more demanding. In edge systems, the substantial memory demand often becomes a deployment bottleneck, limiting the application scenarios for these models. While model quantization can effectively reduce the required memory and computational load, maintaining excellent performance at extremely low bit rates has always been a major challenge. This session will introduce the concept of quantization, providing a brief introduction to its concepts, followed by a discussion of the limitations of quantization at low bit depths. Next, we will discuss the [BitNet](https://github.com/microsoft/BitNet) series of methods, discussing how the research team utilizes three weight values (-1, 0, +1) to represent LLM weights in under 2 bits. In addition to adjustments in weight representation, we will also cover quantization at the activation layer level and the performance improvements achievable through selective quantization based on activation sensitivity. Finally, from the perspective of scaling laws, we will discuss BitNet's existing models and potential future developments. We look forward to opening up new avenues for the application of LLMs on edge devices through extreme quantization."

        "description": "Open source policies and public code are not merely about choosing a license—they embody an entire vision for how public service ecosystems can grow.\r\n\r\nIn the conventional world of government procurement, proprietary systems, vendor lock-in, and highly customized specifications are deeply entrenched. These practices are backed by a relatively \"stable\"—or one might say conservative—accountability framework and interests relationships.\r\n\r\nWhen public policy shifts from closed to open source, the burden of this paradigm shift falls squarely on the shoulders of civil servants and vendors. Who dares to take responsibility for “innovation”—or, more accurately, risk? Who is accountable if a bug is found in the open source code? How can public-private partnership be structured? What is a sustainable model for ongoing maintenance? More fundamentally, what does a flourishing public open source ecosystem look like? Could industry competitors collaborate on shared codebases and still profit—not by undercutting each other’s costs, but by contributing to common infrastructure?\r\n\r\nWhile the benefits of open source—such as transparency and early risk detection—are widely acknowledged, are these perspectives truly internalized within institutions?\r\nThis talk is delivered by a former architect at Taiwan’s Ministry of Digital Affairs. Drawing from first-hand experience, the speaker will explore the structural and cultural challenges of implementing open source as a foundational principle in public digital infrastructure."

        "description": "在這場演講中，我將跟大家分享一種使用 Nix 來優化機器學習模型容器的方法。\r\n\r\n我們知道，把機器學習（ML）模型包裝成 Web 服務並部署在容器中，是現在非常常見的做法。但這樣的系統也帶來了一些挑戰，特別是在依賴管理上。大多數ML 模型是用 Python 寫的，而 Python 的生態系繁雜、依賴眾多，這些依賴最終都會以檔案系統物件的形式體現在映像中。\r\n\r\n如果你的系統需要部署多個 ML 模型，那麼很可能這些容器之間會有大量相同的依賴。這也意味著，如果能把這些通用依賴打包在一起，作為共用的映像層，我們就有機會大幅減少整體容器映像的儲存空間。\r\n\r\n這裡就引入了 Nix。\r\n\r\nNix 是一個功能強大的套件管理系統，它支援構建符合 Open Container Initiative（OCI）標準的容器映像。這些映像在構建時會將所有依賴完整封裝進來，同時排除那些不必要的中間產物，也就是說，它可以讓你打造出更乾淨、體積更小的容器映像。\r\n\r\n雖然 Nix 本身提供了一些基本功能來支援多層映像的構建，但當映像中涉及的 Nix 儲存路徑數量過多時，它沒辦法自動找出一個在多個映像之間共用的最佳分層方式。\r\n\r\n於是我進一步研究並證明了這件事：對於任意一組使用 Nix 儲存路徑構建出來的映像，的確存在一種最佳分層結構，可以用來最小化整體儲存空間的使用。\r\n\r\n接下來，我會向大家說明這個最佳分層是如何被識別出來的，並展示我所設計的演算法——它不只可以用來建構映像，也能分析並優化它們的分層結構。\r\n\r\n這個方法不僅適用於 ML 模型部署，也對任何需要在多個容器間重用套件和依賴的場景具有實際價值。"

        "description": "In this talk I discuss a method for optimizing machine learning model containers using Nix.  Using containers to expose machine learning (ML) models as web services is a common approach to ML model deployment.  However, ML models are often written in Python and require numerous dependencies that manifest as filesystem objects. Systems that require multiple ML model containers often share these dependencies across containers, yielding an opportunity to reduce the storage footprint of container images by designing image layers that carry common dependencies.\r\n\r\nNix is a package management system that includes tools for building container images that conform to Open Container Initiative (OCI) standards and that include the dependency closure of the software payload whilst omitting unnecessary software artifacts.  While Nix includes basic support for building multi-layer images, it fails to produce optimal layering across multiple images when the number of Nix store paths exceeds a certain threshold.\r\n\r\nI show that for any combination of images with a given number of Nix store paths, there exists an optimal layering structure that minimizes the aggregate storage footprint across all images within the combination.  I explain how to identify the optimal structure and demonstrate algorithms for image construction and analysis."

Starting from 0, it grew into a community that regularly organizes activities and accumulates hundreds of members within a year.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll talk about how to build a community from scratch, including:\r\n- How to find the first members and focus on topics\r\n- Designing and maintaining community rules and culture.\r\n- Selection of tools for program flow and registration mechanism.\r\n- How to enhance the sense of participation and growth of members.\r\n- How to avoid burnout of community operators so that you can enjoy it in the long run.\r\n\r\nIf you've ever wanted to build your own community, or are curious about the Side Project that doesn't involve writing a program, welcome to share this real-life community management journey with us!

Since then, the newspaper's nearly 20 years of news and commentary on Taiwan's past life, society, entertainment, and politics have disappeared from the Internet. Similar to its sister newspaper, the Apple Daily in Hong Kong, which was dissolved for multiple reasons, the newspaper's website, which contained a large amount of records on the lives of ordinary people, is now offline. News about important contemporary events such as the Sunflower and Umbrella movements, including written reports and audio-visual content, are no longer available online to the general public, which has had a significant impact on education, research, and the preservation of contemporary history. This report will share our experience in organizing and converting the Archive Team's 2022 archive of Taiwan's Apple Daily website in WARC (Web ARChive) format, and building a research dataset of hundreds of thousands of news articles. We used IPTC (International Press Telecommunications Council) ninjs (News in JSON) format to transcribe the content of this archive into a searchable database. It is hoped that our attempt will revitalize the public access and research use of such orphan newspapers.\r\n\r\nThis sharing is partly based on our April 2025 report in Web Archiving Conferene 2025 (WAC2025): Recently Orphaned Newspapers: From Archived Webpages to Reusable Datasets and Research Outlooks ().

        "title": "OCA's international open source project organization's DevOps build and specification - how to manage over 200 repo projects.",
        "description": "In 250 words or less in Chinese, please give a full description of the program so that the audience can fully understand the program and what they can expect to get out of it. This paragraph is scheduled to be published on the official website of the conference! In this session, I will only introduce OCA (Odoo Community Association)'s experience in Linting, Testing and OCA GitHub bot and its practical operation.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, let's briefly understand the scale of OCA. OCA currently has over 200 Repos, hundreds of contributors, and thousands of modules in total. Not only that, each module has a different version of branch, and one version is updated every year. In order to maintain the quality of the project, it is impractical to rely only on human resources to manage the project, so OCA has established the infrastructure for contributing and managing the project many years ago.\r\n\r\nThe contribution process to note is (1) Git Commit, and (2) CI Testing, and then (3) GitHub Merge, which corresponds to the Linting, Testing, and OCA GitHub Bot that I mentioned at the beginning. Let's go through the process a little bit. First, we find a bug in the program, and then we try to Fork the project and Clone to the local side to modify the program code, after the modification is completed, we (1) Git Commit our changes, and upload to the cloud and send a Pull Request to the original project, at this time the PR has to be first through (2) CI Testing to determine whether or not it passes all the tests, and finally, when the contributor and the administrator to discuss and modify after the completion of the PR can be incorporated into (3) GitHub Bot, and then we can use it as the basis for the PR to be included in (4) GitHub Bot. Finally, when the discussion and modification between the contributor and the administrator are completed, it is the right time to incorporate the PR into (3) GitHub Merge into the project, and it's a great moment.\r\n\r\nIn the contribution process, the maintainer can receive a lot of PRs with a lot of (1) Git Commits a day, if each of them is suggested one by one, it will be very exhausting to the enthusiasm of the open source maintainer, so OCA uses the pre-commit tool and the oca-addons-repo-template to maintain the minimum quality of the commits.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, project maintainers don't have the time to check all the programs one by one, so they use the unique (2) CI Testing in GitHub Action to keep an eye on whether the code passes the basic verification, and in particular, since Odoo is a full-end application with business logic, just because the code can run, it doesn't mean that the program and the data logic are correctly run, so there is a runboat running Ku, a tool that uses a Ku-addons-repo-template to maintain the minimum quality of the commit. Therefore, there is a Runboat that uses Kubernetes dynamics to build a test run environment for maintainers to do basic verification and validation.\r\n\r\nFinally, after the PR has been reviewed, there is (3) GitHub Merge to the original project, which can be done by the OCA GitHub Bot to complete the final step. The most exciting thing is that all of these are open source, welcome to learn and exchange : ) (Notice: The English content is automatically translated and may contain inaccuracies or misinterpretations.

Do you know where this key comes from? Why is it that the first step in every Linux installation tutorial is to ask you to disable secure boot, and then nothing else? This talk takes you from the UEFI start, through the secure boot to the Linux kernel loading, and introduces you to the open source world of how to get out from under the control of the evil corporations through the machine owner key, and use your own key to sign your own boot loader and kernel. Booting into an operating system is the first step to success, and there are many more security mechanisms that can be enabled besides secure boot. Full disk encryption prevents people from stealing your computer and reading its contents directly, but there are some limitations in the boot loader's support for full disk encryption, and an in-depth analysis of grub reveals that it doesn't have write-on-file behavior. This article will also introduce how to view these advanced security settings in Linux through tools, and share the experience of using LLM to analyze the code during debugging, and trace the kernel all the way back from the GNOME desktop.

Over the past two decades, there have been numerous real-world examples. In general, because General Public Licenses are used by large communities, imposing additional restrictions on recipients’ exercise of the rights granted by the licenses is considered impermissible. Stricter conditions, in particular, are generally not accepted; if such changes are truly necessary, a new license name should be adopted to avoid confusion. In contrast, strategic loosening of license terms—typically framed as exceptions—has been more commonly observed, as it usually avoids legal disputes.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explore the feasibility and practical implications of modifying General Public Licenses by examining license texts, official positions of license stewards, and key case studies. Examples will include the license transitions of Redis, MongoDB, and iTextSharp, as well as proposed supplemental licensing clauses for sovereign AI development."

        "description": "Try to search in your brain. Have you remembered anything about the four major public funds other than their entering into the stock market in order to stabilise it?\r\nThe Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) started its observation and research on Taiwan's four major government funds - Postal Savings Fund, Labor Pension Fund, Labor Insurance Fund, and Public Service Pension Fund since 2021. It is found that although the four major funds have committed their investments to comply with the government's 2050 net-zero policy and to consider the impacts of long-term investments, they lack corresponding “sustainable investment” actions, which is tantamount to exacerbating climate change. Meanwhile, the opacity of the “investment targets” and “climate risks” has seriously jeopardized the people's right to know and civic participation.\r\nEJF and the Open Culture Foundation (OCF) are working together to expose the financial risks that the current investment policies of the four major public funds pose to people through open source tools, open data, and climate scenario analysis. We would like to encourage people to take action to demand that the four funds invest in a sustainable environment and future.\r\nIn this program you can learn:\r\nThe contradictions and barriers between the way the four major public funds operate and national climate goals.\r\nThe real-world and individual financial implications due to climate change risk.\r\nHow open source tools and open data can make information and initiatives more impactful.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther references:\r\n* August 2024,  Burning Capital: How Taiwan’s public funds risk public assets and fuel the climate crisis  Report: https://reurl.cc/vQGxEo \r\n* June 2024, OP-ed  Should Pension Funds Still Invest in Fossil Fuel as Climate Risks Increase?  https://reurl.cc/bWeodM"

We’ll explore how telecom’s future is being shaped by three major forces:\r\n\r\nOpenness: Beyond Open RAN — open standards, testing, and software.\r\n\r\nCloud-Native: Not just Kubernetes. Telecom-specific frameworks like Nephio are redefining automation.\r\n\r\nAI: Powering smart networks — from failure prediction to using idle base stations for AI workloads.\r\n\r\nWe’ll challenge assumptions like “Open RAN will fix everything” and “Cloud-native means Kubernetes,” and show how testing telecom systems is now possible on a laptop.\r\n\r\nUltimately, telecom is evolving — from hardware to software, from manual to autonomous. If you're tracking the future of AI, networks, or cloud, this session will change how you see the industry."

        "description": "In recent years, there has been a considerable surge in interest in tiny machine learning (TinyML). Despite this heightened attention, the translation of its theoretical promise into substantive real-world applications within engineering contexts remains notably limited. Structural inspection of critical infrastructure presents significant safety challenges when performed manually, particularly for bolt connections in steel structures and exterior wall tiles.\r\nThis paper presents an innovative approach that integrates TinyML with climbing robots to enable autonomous, real-time structural defect detection in resource-constrained environments. Two complementary case studies are examined: a magnetic climbing robot using the FOMO (Faster Objects, More Objects) algorithm for visual bolt defect inspection in steel structures, and a vacuum-based climbing robot employing CNN-based acoustic analysis for tile defect detection on building exteriors.\r\nThe magnetic robot achieved 82% accuracy with an inference time of just 86ms while requiring minimal memory resources (0.072MB flash memory, 239.1KB RAM). The vacuum-based robot demonstrated 74.62% accuracy in distinguishing between defective and intact tiles through acoustic signature analysis. Both implementations showcase TinyML's versatility across different sensing modalities and structural inspection domains."

This method offers developers a new working paradigm that utilizes natural language descriptions of intent to assist in program development, complementing traditional programming skills.\r\n\r\nThis presentation explores practical applications of Vibe Coding in open data projects such as Wikidata and OpenStreetMap. We will analyze the complete workflow of data project development—from exploratory analysis and information organization to code quality, security, and maintenance issues. We'll discuss how Vibe Coding can reshape data projects, lower technical barriers, and consequently expand community collaboration and participation."

        "description": "As a graduate student with a background in computer science, my journey did not begin with artificial intelligence or medical image segmentation. Initially, I often felt overwhelmed and anxious about the steep technical barriers posed by deep learning and model training. However, thanks to the open-source community and the wealth of available tools, I had the opportunity to start from scratch and gradually build my own AI research project.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will share my journey from the perspective of a newcomer without a formal background in AI. I will explain how I leveraged public medical datasets, the PyTorch framework, and open-source models on GitHub—such as Vision Mamba UNet—to develop a practical, research-ready medical image segmentation system. By reading documentation, studying open-source code, and participating in developer communities, I gained valuable hands-on experience and learned how to complete a research project even with limited resources.\r\n\r\nThis session focuses on real-world insights such as “how to get started with AI through open-source,” “the challenges and lessons learned from building my first project,” and “common mistakes beginners should avoid.” I hope my experience will encourage more students and developers who are curious about AI but have not yet taken the first step: you do not need to build everything from scratch. By making the most of open-source resources, you can go farther—and do so with greater confidence—on your AI journey."

Since October 2014, it has been published in multiple languages, and by 2025, we’ve reached over 770 issues. It’s made possible by a global group of contributors, including dedicated members of the Taiwanese OSM community.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we’ll give you a peek behind the curtain and show how each issue comes together. We’ll walk through how we collect news from OSM diaries, blogs, and community channels using a tool called OSMBC. Then we’ll explain how articles are written in English, reviewed for accuracy, and translated into different languages before being published. All of this happens thanks to a team of volunteers, working across time zones and languages.\r\n\r\nWe’ll also share how local communities like Taiwan help make weeklyOSM better — both by translating content and by making sure local news gets into the global conversation.\r\n\r\nOf course, we’ll talk about some of the challenges too: keeping up weekly momentum, finding new contributors, and making sure the content stays relevant for both new mappers and long-time contributors.\r\n\r\nIf you’re curious about how weeklyOSM works, or if you’ve ever thought about contributing, come join us! We hope to spark ideas for how communities can work together to share news, knowledge, and updates — and keep the OSM world connected."

What started as a one-person effort organizing the first event has grown into a vibrant community, with each meetup now regularly attracting 30 to 40 participants. By leveraging the Odoo system, I automated processes such as registration, email communication, and surveys, significantly improving operational efficiency.\r\n\r\nAs the community expanded, I realized the importance of teamwork and successfully attracted passionate, ambitious young people interested in open source to join and help co-organize the community.\r\n\r\nThrough data analysis, we adjusted event formats to ignite engagement—for instance, separating sessions for business users and developers, and encouraging talks from our own community members. We later launched book discussion events to deepen connections and plan to expand internationally by participating in open source conferences like COSCUP.\r\n\r\nOdoo Community Taiwan has become more than just a platform to learn Odoo—it's a growing ecosystem that embodies the spirit of open source.

I'll explain how regular scheduling creates responsibility and momentum among volunteers, transforming support from individual work to group activity, building a sustainable support system.\r\nI'll also discuss how we incorporated Japanese cultural elements while adapting global best practices to regional needs. The session will present case studies of particularly challenging or interesting forum questions, demonstrating how community teamwork led to effective solutions.\r\nPlease join us to discover how each individual's small contributions make a significant difference, and how supporting users in their native language creates a more inclusive and sustainable open source ecosystem."

This allows users to download files they were never meant to access. In this talk, I’ll walk through a real-world Rails example, showing how a seemingly normal Active Storage setup can expose sensitive documents to unauthorized users. We’ll break down how the vulnerability happens step by step and explore practical ways to fix it. And here’s a question worth asking: Just because someone has a file’s URL, does that mean they’re authorized to view it? This kind of issue isn’t unique to Rails—it can happen in any software. As developers, it’s worth taking a moment to think twice."

In this talk, I’ll share the story of my very first contribution: fixing a bug in ⁠swift-format that caused annoying error popups in Xcode 16. From discovering the issue, hesitating at the first step, fumbling through the repo, to finally submitting (and surviving) my first Pull Request, I’ll walk you through the entire journey.\r\n\r\nThis wasn’t just a technical challenge — it was a process of overcoming self-doubt, breaking through my comfort zone, and connecting with the open source community. Through my story, I hope you’ll see that even as a total beginner, you can find a sense of belonging in the community and make a difference with just a little bit of courage. If you’ve ever wanted to join open source but hesitated to take the leap, this talk is for you.\r\n\r\n## Key Takeaways\r\n\r\n- You don’t have to be an expert to make a meaningful contribution to open source\r\n- Getting started is easier than you think—all it takes is the willingness to try\r\n- The open source community is warmer and more welcoming than you might expect"

        "description": "Real-world puzzles are a new type of interactive games in recent years, usually utilizing real scenes with virtual storylines, allowing players to gain a deeper understanding of the local culture and history through the puzzle process.\r\n\r\nWhen the speaker was working in a community college, he had participated in the design of a real-life puzzle, which was constructed on a LINE chat robot. However, due to the problems of maintenance, the LINE chat robot could not be used any more, and the game was faced with the dilemma of not being able to be used any more.\r\n\r\nNot wanting to see his hard work disappear, the speaker tried to find a game platform that was \"good to use, good to look at, and independent of data\". Unfortunately, these three things hardly intersected with each other, so he decided to write his own, and this is the origin of MiSheng.\r\n\r\nMiSheng uses spreadsheets to edit the flow, store levels, props, and hints. For one thing, spreadsheets are the software most people use, and for another, the structured data is also very convenient for programs to analyze and use. After editing the spreadsheet, drop the file into MiSheng's specific folder, and you can easily generate your own real-world puzzles.\r\n\r\nIn addition, since MiSheng's code is open source, future users can download spreadsheet templates, choose the platforms they want to deploy, master their own game data, and even develop new features on their own! You don't have to worry about the risk of losing your work due to platform changes.\r\n\r\nThis talk will share the process of developing MiSheng, welcome friends who are interested in real-world puzzles to join and discuss.

EDK II is an open-source implementation of UEFI firmware, with contributors from around the world, including hardware vendors, device manufacturers, and individual developers interested in firmware technology. I will explain how I started as a beginner by reading source code, fixing minor issues, and participating in discussion threads. Step by step, I became a technical contributor, integrated into the community, collaborated with global open-source developers, and eventually had the opportunity to speak at FOSDEM, the largest open-source conference in Europe.\r\n\r\nThrough this talk, I hope to give aspiring developers who want to participate in large-scale open-source projects a clearer idea of how to get started. I also want to highlight that being part of an open-source community is not only about writing code. It is also a journey of personal growth and expanding one’s global perspective. I aim to encourage more developers from Taiwan to engage with the international open-source community and enhance their global impact."

        "description": "At ExpressVPN, we're constantly exploring new ways to enhance privacy and security. One area that's captured our attention is open source hardware - particularly RISC-V - which we see as a natural evolution in building more transparent infrastructure. Just as Linux transformed software, we think RISC-V could bring similar innovation to hardware. We've already open-sourced our Lightway protocol, and we're exploring how to extend this transparency philosophy deeper into our stack - including potentially our TrustedServer platform. Now we're investigating how open hardware fits into our broader zero trust strategy.

        "description": "At ExpressVPN, we're constantly exploring new ways to enhance privacy and security. One area that's captured our attention is open source hardware - particularly RISC-V - which we see as a natural evolution in building more transparent infrastructure. Just as Linux transformed software, we think RISC-V could bring similar innovation to hardware. We've already open-sourced our Lightway protocol, and we're exploring how to extend this transparency philosophy deeper into our stack - including potentially our TrustedServer platform. Now we're investigating how open hardware fits into our broader zero trust strategy.

        "title": "SmartTB5: A 5G-Enabled Mobile Robot Powered by TinyFusion Edge AI Module",
        "description": "This presentation introduces a novel 5G-enabled mobile robotic system named SmartTB5, which integrates the sensory intelligence of the TinyFusion edge AI module with the autonomous mobility of the TurtleBot3 platform. The objective of this project is to demonstrate how Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) can be deployed on embedded hardware to enable real-time robotic perception and action without relying on cloud-based computation.\r\nTinyFusion is a custom-designed, low-power embedded module capable of running TinyML models using platforms such as Edge Impulse and TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers. Equipped with multiple onboard sensors including audio, vibration, visual, and environmental sensing. TinyFusion collects live input data from the environment. This data is then processed locally using lightweight, pre-trained machine learning models that have been trained, optimized, and deployed directly to the device.\r\nThe TinyML workflow begins with collecting data from sensors, which is then used to train models using Edge Impulse. This platform provides tools for data preprocessing, feature extraction (e.g., MFCC for audio, FFT for vibration), model training, and model optimization. The resulting models are quantized to reduce memory usage and exported in a format suitable for embedded deployment. Once deployed to TinyFusion, the device performs on-device inference, detecting patterns or anomalies in real time.\r\nIn the SmartTB5 architecture, TinyFusion serves as the sensory AI front-end, responsible for analyzing input signals and producing inference results (such as \"glass breaking detected\", \"fall detected\", or \"person approaching\"). These results are sent via serial communication (UART or AT commands) to the TurtleBot3, which runs the Robot Operating System (ROS). Upon receiving the inference result, TurtleBot3 executes corresponding actions such as navigating to a location, avoiding obstacles, triggering an alarm, or sending a status update to a remote dashboard.\r\nBy performing inference locally on TinyFusion, the system minimizes latency, conserves network bandwidth, and enhances privacy. It is also well-suited for offline or low-connectivity environments. The entire system supports 5G or Wi-Fi communication, enabling use cases such as remote monitoring, over-the-air updates, and cloud-assisted multi-robot coordination if needed.\r\nUse case scenarios include:\r\n•Smart patrol and autonomous indoor navigation\r\n•Anomaly detection for industrial or smart home environments\r\n•Fall or distress detection in elder care scenarios\r\n•Voice-activated or gesture-triggered robot control\r\nThe design of SmartTB5 is modular and open-source friendly. Developers can collect their own datasets, retrain models via Edge Impulse, and easily deploy them to TinyFusion for testing and iteration. This makes the system ideal for academic research, robotics competitions, or real-world AIoT product development.\r\nThis session will present the system architecture, the TinyML training workflow, communication design between TinyFusion and TurtleBot3, and demonstration results. It will also explore the challenges of TinyML deployment in embedded robotics and offer insights into how this architecture can empower next-generation edge AI applications."

Through real-world examples, we explore the possibilities of Bot in different application scenarios and help developers design more interactive and practical tools.\r\n\r\nWe hope that the audience can realize what Discord BOT is good for, and make a convenient and useful BOT according to their own needs.\r\n- For Python beginners, there must be a stage when they make a small tool or toy and want to share it with their friends, but because their friends don't have the basic knowledge of the program or the Python environment, and because they don't have the ability of their own minions, it's hard to share their tools or toys with other people. With Discord BOT, you can have a simple front-end for your friends to call and use, and you can even use it with multiple people.\r\n- For those who haven't written any chatbot before, you can get to know Discord BOT, it's not difficult to get started and there are more variations than Telegram or Line.

        "description": "An Open Source Program Office (OSPO) is a dedicated unit within a company or organization responsible for managing collaboration involving open source software. Whether structured as a physical office or a virtual, task-oriented team, the core function of an OSPO is to oversee the adoption, distribution, and legal compliance of open source software. Its role extends beyond internal “use” of open source—it also promotes active external “participation” in open source communities to strengthen collaboration and ensure compliance across the software supply chain.\r\n\r\nAlthough the concept of an OSPO has become increasingly well-defined, its implementation must still be tailored to each organization’s size, R&D structure, and cultural context. There is no one-size-fits-all model; OSPO planning and operations should be adapted to specific internal needs and practical constraints.\r\n\r\nThis talk draws on hands-on experience assisting Taiwanese companies in establishing OSPOs and will outline four key legal and governance considerations for effective open source management:\r\n\r\n1. Establishing and maintaining version control systems (Version Control Systems, VCS);\r\n2. Defining Approval and Rejection Lists in open source policies;\r\n3. Developing clear guidelines and review procedures for upstream contributions;\r\n4. Understanding and addressing the compliance implications of Copyleft license terms."

It has a long development history, which has led to a vast number of translatable strings involved in localization. This makes the task too large for a single person to handle — it requires a team effort.\r\n\r\nOn the various language versions of Wikipedia built on MediaWiki, how are translation modules used to translate content across different sites? The Chinese Wikipedia’s language conversion system was originally built with the intention of seeking common ground while respecting differences and promoting mutual understanding. However, due to significant ideological differences across regions, it can only handle the translation and conversion of Chinese terms at the word and phrase level.\r\n\r\nHow do things like the Wikipedia event announcements and donation messages you often see actually work? And how are Taiwanese Han characters or Pe̍h-ōe-jī (Taiwanese Romanization) translated into MediaWiki interface strings?\r\n\r\nCome to this session and you’ll find out."

        "description": "Nix 是一個開源的套件管理系統，主要針對 Unix 類系統所設計。它不僅僅是一個套件管理器，更是一個讓軟體構建與部署過程變得可預測、可重複的完整生態系統。\r\n\r\n這次演講我會聚焦在三個主題上：\r\n1. Nix 程式設計語言\r\n2. 使用 Nix 打包軟體\r\n3. 利用 Nix flakes 建立可重複的開發環境\r\n我們會先從 Nix 的基本概念開始談起，理解它是如何管理軟體與環境，然後再深入這三個主題。\r\n\r\n首先，來看看 Nix 語言本身。這是一種純函數式語言，它具有延遲求值、動態型別的特性，最主要的用途是用來描述軟體套件的內容。等一下我會透過一些簡單的程式碼範例，帶大家一步一步認識這門語言。\r\n\r\n接著，我們會討論 Nix 如何處理軟體打包。在 Nix 的世界裡，每個軟體包被定義為一個「衍生品」，英文叫 derivation。你可以把它想像成一個建構配方，它描述了如何從一組輸入建構出一個特定的軟體。這些衍生品是用 Nix 語言來撰寫的，而當我們執行構建命令時，Nix 會根據這些描述產出一個「儲存元素」（store path）。這些儲存元素是不可變的，而且是根據建構輸入的雜湊值來命名的，這也意味著：如果你看到兩個名稱相同的儲存元素，那它們的內容幾乎可以確定是一模一樣的。\r\n\r\n最後，我們會談到可重複的環境建構。這是 Nix 最令人驚艷的地方之一。因為所有衍生結果都是不可變、且唯一命名的，我們可以精確地還原出一個開發或執行環境，不管是在你的筆電、同事的電腦，還是幾個月後的伺服器上——效果都是一樣的。我會以 Nix flakes 為例，這是一種新穎但仍在實驗階段的打包方式，來示範如何定義並重現一個完整的開發環境。"

        "description": "Nix is an open-source, functional package manager for Unix-like systems. In this talk I give (1) an introduction to the Nix programming language, (2) packaging software with Nix, and (3) creating reproducible environments with Nix flakes. I begin with an overview of Nix and how it manages software before proceeding with the aforementioned items.\r\n\r\nThe Nix programming language is purely functional, lazily evaluated, and dynamically typed language that is used for defining the contents of software packages. In this part, I describe the Nix language and walk through example code.\r\n\r\nAfter introducing the language, I explain how software packages are defined in Nix, as \"derivations\" written in the Nix language. Nix's build commands accept derivations as inputs and produce Nix store elements as outputs. Nix store elements are immutable and named with cryptographic hashes that are based on build inputs, ensuring that any two store elements with the same name almost surely contain identical contents.\r\n\r\nThe third and final topic I cover is that of reproducible environments. Because the results of all Nix derivations are immutable and uniquely named, and because development environments consist of a set of derivation results, development environments defined by Nix can be made identical across time and workstations. I discuss how Nix environments are defined and provide an example using Nix flakes, an experimental approach to packaging Nix-based projects."

This program uses RISC-V hardware to explain and validate heterogeneous multicore communication: the \"small core\" running on the ThreadX real-time operating system is loaded with a small amount of well-defined code, and the Linux running on the \"big core\" is enabled to communicate with ThreadX through RPMsg. When the Linux kernel is under high load or even out of progress due to a driver error, the control tasks of the small core can still be maintained to ensure the operation of the device. When the Linux kernel is under high load due to driver errors, or even when there is no progress, the small kernel's control tasks can still be maintained to ensure the safety of the device. The agenda will also discuss the porting and integration of development frameworks such as RPMsg, remoteproc and OpenAMP.

        "description": "電子紙顯示器因其低功耗與高對比度特性，廣泛應用於電子閱讀器與低功耗顯示設備。然而，現有解決方案多數仰賴使用者空間的控制邏輯，不僅缺乏統一的開源驅動，整合性與彈性也相對不足。\r\n為此，我開發了一款針對小尺寸電子紙面板的開源 Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) 驅動，將顯示控制邏輯下移至 Linux 核心層，支援標準 DRM 架構與 SPI 傳輸介面。該驅動實作於 Renesas RZ/V2H 平台（開發板：kakip（カキピー））上，具備良好的嵌入式整合性，並期望 upstream 至主線，作為未來開發者整合電子紙至 Linux 顯示架構的參考實作。"

        "title": "Journey of developing DRM driver for 4-color small-size e-paper",
        "description": "Electronic paper displays are commonly used in e-readers and low-power display devices because they consume little power and offer high contrast. However, most existing solutions rely on user space control, lack open source drivers, and do not provide adequate integration or flexibility. To address these issues, I developed an open source Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) driver for small-size e-paper displays. This driver moves the control logic into the Linux kernel, supports the standard DRM framework, and communicates via the SPI interface. It is implemented on the Renesas RZ/V2H platform (development board: Kakip), offering strong integration for embedded use cases. My goal is to upstream this driver to the mainline as a reference implementation to help future developers integrate e-paper technology into the Linux display architecture."

        "description": "\"Taste of Data, Memory of Flavors\", a special exhibition on Taiwanese food memories, marks a milestone in the National Museum of Taiwan History’s stewardship of the National Cultural Memory Bank 2.0. This exhibition weaves together open-call data collected during Taiwan’s Forward-Looking Infrastructure Phase I, community participation initiatives from Phase II, and artifacts from major national institutions—including the Taiwan Film and Audiovisual Institute, NMTH’s own archives, and iconic venues like the Grand Hotel banquet archives.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition blends the virtual and the physical to reconstruct sensory memories—sight, sound, and interaction—to evoke the tastes and smells of Taiwan's cultural heritage.\r\n\r\nAs someone who supported community engagement during the open data development phase, I later co-curated an online exhibition titled \"Edible Memories\" with Prof. Hsieh Shih-Yuan from National Cheng Kung University, involving six community partners. Interestingly, portions of that digital exhibition have now been deconstructed and re-presented in the physical space of the \"Taste of Data\" exhibition.\r\n\r\nThis raises critical curatorial questions: when the original materials—digital files, texts, metadata—existed only as born-digital objects, how should the contributions of initial curators and community collaborators be credited in subsequent reinterpretations? In an era where the \"original\" is increasingly synonymous with \"digital data,\" what models of attribution, visibility, and ethical boundaries do we need in place?\r\n\r\nThese reflections emerge from both past involvement in initial data creation and renewed encounters with its repurposing in a national-level exhibition. How can we better honor the often-invisible labor and local knowledge that shape our shared cultural narratives?"

        "description": "意圖導向（intent-centric）是近期區塊鏈應用的發展趨勢，它透過抽象化操作的方式提升效率和使用者體驗。然而，實際開發 intent-centric app 的時候也會遇到一些過往沒有的技術挑戰。\r\n\r\n求解器（solver）的中心化問題：\r\n意圖導向應用相當於讓使用者和區塊鏈的互動模式從 imperative 走向 declarative，好處除了簡化操作，也給予求解器彈性，有機會創造更好的執行結果，但也正是這樣的彈性，讓使用者對求解器多了一層信任假設。\r\n\r\n以資產交易為例，原本使用者發起的操作內容可能是「到 Curve 上用 USDT 換 USDC，再去 Uniswap 把 USDC 換成 ETH」，現在變成「用 5000 USDT 換到不少於 2 ETH」。前者的執行結果未必是最好，不過至少是使用者指定的兌換方式；而後者在求解器運作得宜時會得到更好的執行結果，但操弄的空間始終存在，需要對 surplus shifting 之類的不良行為設下限制。\r\n\r\n和帳號抽象（AA, account abstraction）的競合：\r\n意圖導向和帳號抽象是差不多時間開始發展的方案，兩者時常處於競爭關係，甚至有彼此妨礙的部分。它們想解決的區塊鏈使用者體驗問題有部分重疊，比方說 gas fee。而 AA 的發展讓合約錢包普及率上升，對 intent-centric app 卻可能是個壞消息。從架構設計層面而言，很多 intent 都是基於鏈下的密碼學簽名，這對普通的私鑰錢包（EOA）很容易，但 AA 錢包卻未必都有實作類似的方法，即便有，也需要鏈上合約乃至 solver 的額外支援。當然，也有 intent-centric app（CoWAMM）用了重載過的 EIP1271 來提供表現力比 EOA 更好的 intent，充分發揮垂直整合的優勢，不過那就是後話了。\r\n\r\n麻煩的是，由於帳號抽象和各種 DApp 的相容性還不太好，很多 AA 錢包都做成了白名單特定功能在錢包裡的模式。那麼，理所當然的，總是傳統鏈上送交易的合約先被整合，反過來說，intent-centric app 大概也只能建議使用者先用傳統錢包。如果要克服這個不良循環，就需要在設計 intent 的時候考慮到更多不同錢包類型，或者提供多種操作方式，暫時讓鏈上直送交易和鏈下簽名並存。"

        "title": "Challenges of developing intent-centric apps",
        "description": "Intent-centric is a recent trend in the development of blockchain apps, which improves efficiency and user experience by abstracting operations. However, the actual development of intent-centric apps also encounters some technical challenges that were not present in the past.\r\n\r\nSolver centricity:\r\nIntent-oriented apps are equivalent to making the interaction mode between users and the blockchain go from imperative to declarative, which not only simplifies the operation, but also gives the solver the flexibility to create better execution results, but it is also the flexibility that makes users have an extra layer of trust assumptions about the solver.\r\n\r\nTaking asset trading as an example, an operation initiated by a user might be \"go to Curve and exchange USDT for USDC, then go to Uniswap and exchange USDC for ETH\", but now it will be \"exchange 5000 USDT for not less than 2 ETH\". The former may not be the best result, but at least it's the conversion method specified by the user. The latter will yield better results when the solver is working properly, but there is always room for manipulation, and there needs to be a limit on undesirable behavior such as surplus shifting.\r\n\r\nCompetition with AA (account abstraction):\r\nIdea-guided and account abstraction were developed around the same time, and they are often in competition with each other, and even have parts that interfere with each other. There is some overlap in the blockchain user experience problems they are trying to solve, such as gas fees, and the growth of AA, which has led to an increase in the popularity of contract wallets, may be bad news for intent-centric apps. From an architectural design perspective, many of the intents are based on cryptographic signatures down the chain, which is easy for normal private key wallets (EOA), but AA wallets may not always have a similar method of implementation, and even if they do, it requires additional support from the contract on the chain, or even from the solver. Of course, there are intent-centric apps (CoWAMM) that use a reloaded EIP1271 to provide better-performing intent than EOA, taking full advantage of vertical integration, but that's a story for another day.\r\n\r\nTrouble is, because account abstraction is not yet very compatible with various DApps, many AA wallets are made to whitelist specific features in the wallet. So, of course, it's always the traditional contracts that send transactions up the chain that get integrated first, and in turn, intent-centric apps can probably only suggest that users use traditional wallets first. To overcome this undesirable cycle, we need to consider more different wallet types when designing the intent, or provide multiple ways of operation, so that uplinked transactions and downlinked signatures can co-exist for the time being.

        "description": "In the database environment of the financial industry, the huge volume of data and high frequency of transactions pose a great challenge to system performance. Take credit card business as an example, as of Q1 2025, the number of cards in circulation has reached 8.22 million, which is a huge data processing task when added to other business product lines. As a PostgreSQL database administrator in the AI department, we are committed to improving the overall service performance from a system architecture perspective.\r\n\r\nThe first step in performance optimization is to identify suspicious processes that cause bottlenecks, while DBAs and data analysts focus on different aspects of monitoring: DBAs focus on system resources and stability, such as CPU, memory, IO, and WAL size, while data analysts are concerned with query behavior and bottlenecks, such as blocked processes in read-write splits, The data analysts are concerned with query behavior and bottlenecks, such as blocked process in read/write separation, idle in transaction.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we will share how to utilize Prometheus + Grafana to build a PostgreSQL dashboard that can serve both DBAs and data analysts. It covers:\r\n1. how we design and select the right metrics from hundreds of metrics\r\n2. Metrics for DBAs: CPU, memory, disk IO, network traffic, WAL Size, etc. 3. Metrics for data analysts: users, data analysts, data analysts, data analysts, data analysts, etc.\r\n3. Data analyst metrics: user activity (active/idle), query waiting behavior, blocked process, etc.\r\n4. Usage scenarios and promotional experiences after actual implementation: allowing users to find the status of the process in the system more quickly.\r\n\r\nThis agenda is suitable for DBAs, Data Engineers, data platform architects, and data analytics related workers, especially for teams that have the need to introduce observability or want to improve the visualization of the data platform.

However, existing mechanisms exhibit significant performance bottlenecks in specific stages. For instance, filesystem synchronization during the suspend_enter phase often leads to tens of seconds of delay due to I/O queuing. Even with asynchronous processing, the sequential execution of prepare and complete stages, along with hardware synchronization waits in the suspend_late phase, limits parallelization benefits.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to conduct an in-depth analysis of performance bottlenecks within the Linux kernel's suspend/resume flow. We will utilize tracing tools like Perfetto and pm-graph on Intel Core i7-12700H (x86-64) platforms to visualize and quantify I/O activity, CPU C-state transitions, and process freezing timelines. Furthermore, this study will evaluate improvement proposals for asynchronous suspend/resume from the Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML), such as the \"PM: sleep: Improvements of async suspend and resume of devices\" patchset on Linux v6.12+, verifying their actual benefits on different architectures. Ultimately, based on the analysis and existing research, we hope to explore the potential for further reducing overall suspend/resume time through finer-grained locking or stage overlapping mechanisms and propose concrete improvements.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Linux Kernel, Power Management, Suspend/Resume, Performance Analysis, Asynchronous Processing, Perfetto, x86-64"

During this time, I experienced firsthand the rapid surge of AI innovation and confronted the controversies surrounding “copying and repackaging.” This experience led us to deeply reflect: What does “openness” truly mean in the GenAI era? Is simply releasing model weights equivalent to the open-source ethos of sharing source code? How are they fundamentally different in spirit and practice?\r\n\r\nThis talk will use my journey as a starting point to revisit the history of open-source software. We will discover that today’s GenAI evolution strikingly mirrors the past: from the dominance of academia and the high cost of computing, to the rise of commercial companies, and the fierce debate between closed and open approaches, much like Microsoft vs. Linux in the past, and OpenAI vs. Llama/DeepSeek today.\r\n\r\nHowever, history does not simply repeat itself. The proliferation of PCs and the internet fueled the open-source boom back then, but will lowering the cost of computing alone usher in a golden age for open-source AI? We will examine a unique challenge in GenAI: the data problem.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, why are projects like n8n and Dify.ai adopting licenses such as Fair Code, which are not OSI-approved, and how do these challenge our traditional understanding of open source? Is this a regression in history, or an inevitable evolution?\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to address a fundamental question: In an era where AI can write code, what is the future of human-collaboration-based open-source communities? Are we witnessing the dusk of the open-source spirit, or the dawn of a new chapter of co-evolution and human-AI collaboration?\r\n\r\nThis talk is not only a retrospective and a comparison with the past but also an open invitation to all open-source advocates to engage in a shared reflection: How do we define “openness” in the age of GenAI, and how can we find a path toward co-creation and co-governance?"

        "description": "Over the past three years, OCF has partnered with Taiwan’s L10N.TW community, professional translators, and Soft Leader Inc. to implement a software localization project funded by Taiwan’s Ministry of Digital Affairs. This initiative successfully localized key open-source tools including GOV.UK Notify, GOV.UK Forms, Matrix Client (Element), IRMA, Yivi, Standard for Public Code, Bitwarden, Nextcloud, FreeOTP, GIMP, and Mattermost. Several of these contributions have been merged upstream, directly addressing pain points faced by international communities.\r\n\r\nAs the current phase of this government-funded localization project comes to a close and approaches a time of transition, OCF would like to offer reflections from our role as a coordinator: what practical strategies and considerations helped in working effectively with government agencies? What challenges emerged when collaborating with upstream open-source communities, and how did we navigate them?\r\n\r\nBeyond the project’s lifecycle, we are also exploring how accumulated resources—such as glossaries and translation workflows—can serve broader community needs. Recently, we experimented with translating the OSPO Alliance’s Good Governance Handbook using a combination of AI tools and our prior experience translating the Standard for Public Code. The translated content has been integrated into a GPTs-based tool named \"Taiwan L10N Kid,\" used internally to facilitate learning about open technology practices.\r\n\r\nThese small experiments prompt a larger question: how can past efforts in localization be transformed into long-term assets for the Taiwanese open-source community? We welcome others to join us in exploring this direction."

What would be a more efficient workflow? I'll create a co-written spreadsheet, such as an ethercalc or google sheet, with fields for name, address, latitude/longitude, notes, and other textual information, share it with all the members, and then feed the spreadsheet to umap. So whenever any member changes any of the fields [other than address and latitude/longitude], the map viewer just reorganizes the page and sees the most up-to-date information. As for the latitude and longitude, they can be updated manually, either individually or in batches. The threshold for editing a google spreadsheet is much lower than that for editing a map, and this arrangement makes it possible for anyone to participate.

Yet one seemingly “solved” vulnerability—reentrancy attacks—continues to resurface across protocols.\r\n\r\nThese attacks are not isolated bugs, but structural flaws stemming from a fundamental issue: misalignment between state updates and external calls. When exploited, they can lead to repeated withdrawals, logic corruption, and even collapse the integrity of entire systems.\r\n\r\nSecurity breaches on the blockchain often operate like silent assassins—hidden within seemingly legitimate flows.

        "description": "This session presents the design and maintenance of the generic min heap library in the Linux Kernel, focusing on performance optimizations and engineering trade-offs. We implemented a bottom-up variant of the heapify algorithm that reduces the number of comparisons by approximately 50% in typical cases. However, in scenarios such as bcache where many duplicate elements exist in the heap, this variant degrades to O(log n), leading us to provide two heapify APIs to let users choose based on their data characteristics.\r\n\r\nTo further reduce CPU overhead, we applied a prescale counter technique to avoid unnecessary multiplication instructions. We also addressed the increased cost of indirect function calls introduced by retpoline (used for Spectre mitigation). Initially, all min heap functions were marked always_inline to avoid this cost, but as adoption grew, we switched to non-inline versions to reduce kernel image size.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we used C macros to implement a generic min heap mechanism, similar in spirit to C++ templates, while incorporating compile-time type checks for correctness. This talk is intended for audiences interested in kernel-level data structure implementations and performance tuning."

        "description": "It has been three years since COSCUP and OSPN began their exchanged track. Although early efforts faced challenges, the third year marks a turning point where both sides now collaborate more effectively.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the internet has made IT more global, and open source has further accelerated that trend by expanding community scale and diversity. Masafumi Ohta, a contributor to global projects like OpenSolaris, has used this experience to engage in international open source communities, including Raspberry Pi and OpenStack.\r\n\r\nIn this session, Masafumi shares how global collaboration has shaped his open source journey and invites discussion on what individuals and communities can do to grow their projects through global engagement.\r\n\r\n(Japanese)\r\nCOSCUPとOSPNによるトラック交換が始まってから3年が経ちました。当初は準備不足などの課題もありましたが、3年目に入り、ようやくお互いの連携が本格的に機能し始めました。\r\n\r\nインターネットの発展によりITテクノロジーは国境を越えて広がり、オープンソースの普及によってそのグローバル化はさらに加速しています。OSSコミュニティは世界中でつながり、今や多くの人々が国や文化を超えて協働しています。\r\n\r\n私は、OpenSolarisプロジェクトにおいてグローバルな開発経験を持ち、その後もRaspberry PiやOpenStackなどで国際的なオープンソースコミュニティとの連携を深めて相互のオープンソースの規模の拡大に貢献してきました。\r\n\r\n本セッションでは、OSSプロジェクトをより良くするために「グローバル化」の視点がなぜ重要なのかを探り、実際にグローバル規模での連携を行う上で直面する課題や工夫について具体例を交えながら共有します。また、個人や地域コミュニティがどのようにして国際的なネットワークとつながり、より大きなオープンソースエコシステムに参加していけるのかを、皆さんと共に議論したいと思います。是非議論にご参加ください。"

        "description": "It has been three years since COSCUP and OSPN began their exchanged track. Although early efforts faced challenges, the third year marks a turning point where both sides now collaborate more effectively.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the internet has made IT more global, and open source has further accelerated that trend by expanding community scale and diversity. Masafumi Ohta, a contributor to global projects like OpenSolaris, has used this experience to engage in international open source communities, including Raspberry Pi and OpenStack.\r\n\r\nIn this session, Masafumi shares how global collaboration has shaped his open source journey and invites discussion on what individuals and communities can do to grow their projects through global engagement.\r\n\r\n(Japanese)\r\nCOSCUPとOSPNによるトラック交換が始まってから3年が経ちました。当初は準備不足などの課題もありましたが、3年目に入り、ようやくお互いの連携が本格的に機能し始めました。\r\n\r\nインターネットの発展によりITテクノロジーは国境を越えて広がり、オープンソースの普及によってそのグローバル化はさらに加速しています。OSSコミュニティは世界中でつながり、今や多くの人々が国や文化を超えて協働しています。\r\n\r\n私は、OpenSolarisプロジェクトにおいてグローバルな開発経験を持ち、その後もRaspberry PiやOpenStackなどで国際的なオープンソースコミュニティとの連携を深めて相互のオープンソースの規模の拡大に貢献してきました。\r\n\r\n本セッションでは、OSSプロジェクトをより良くするために「グローバル化」の視点がなぜ重要なのかを探り、実際にグローバル規模での連携を行う上で直面する課題や工夫について具体例を交えながら共有します。また、個人や地域コミュニティがどのようにして国際的なネットワークとつながり、より大きなオープンソースエコシステムに参加していけるのかを、皆さんと共に議論したいと思います。是非議論にご参加ください。"

I Chose to Reboot.\r\nJessie Chang, founder of HealYou, was once a product manager debugging systems by day—and quietly battling depression by night.\r\n\r\nIn this 30-minute talk, she shares the story behind HealYou: a mental health platform built not out of ambition, but necessity. Instead of leaving tech, Jessie joined forces with engineers, designers, and therapists to create a space where people could finally say, “I’m not okay”—and be heard.\r\n\r\nBut this isn’t just a story to listen to.\r\nWe’re inviting you to feel it, too.\r\n\r\nJoin Stephy, an art therapist from New York, for a 40-minute guided creative session. No drawing skills needed. No preparation required. Just your presence—and your willingness to let your hands speak what words often can’t.\r\n\r\nStephy\r\n《內在 debug：用藝術掃描你的情緒 bug》\r\nInner Debugging: Managing Stress through Art and Mindfulness\r\n\r\n在科技高速發展的時代，我們習慣debug系統、優化效能，卻常忽略內在情緒系統也會悄悄累積「隱性bug」。\r\n本場藝術表達體驗工作坊，將結合正念練習與創意圖像表達，引導參與者掃描自己的情緒狀態與壓力來源，透過簡單的筆與紙創作，釋放緊繃、重新連結身體與心靈，練習放下過度控制的需求。你將學習如何透過「非語言」的方式養成正念習慣，並帶走可以日常實踐的自我照顧工具。\r\n\r\nIn today’s fast-paced world of technology, we’re used to debugging systems and optimizing performance, but emotional stress can silently build up, like hidden bugs in our internal operating systems.\r\nThis interactive art wellness session combines mindfulness with creative expression to help participants scan their emotional state, identify stress triggers, and release tension, using nothing more than pen and paper. You'll explore how to shift out of “over-control mode” and cultivate self-awareness through symbolic art-making.\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nClosing Remarks + Q&A:  10 min.\r\n\r\nJohn will do a quick recap and open up for Q&A with all the presenters."

As a result, Renesas currently ranks 11th globally in cumulative patches merged into the Linux kernel over the past 20 years.\r\n\r\nThanks to these efforts, the R-Car platform is able to run the latest mainline Linux kernel—generally without the need for additional patches—providing developers with a robust and up- to-date environment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his work with the Linux community, Munakata also actively participates in industry consortia such as Automotive Grade Linux (AGL) and the Connected Vehicle Systems Alliance (COVESA), striving to serve as a bridge between the open source community and the automotive industry."
